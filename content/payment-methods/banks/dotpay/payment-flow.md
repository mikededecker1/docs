The table below shows a successful payment flow from start to finish.  

{{< details title="About order and transaction statuses" >}}

In your MultiSafepay account > **Transaction overview** > **Transaction details** page under **Status history**, there are two statuses that change as the flow progresses: 

- Order status: indicates the status of the customer's order with the merchant independent of the payment
- Transaction status: indicates the status of the payment

{{< /details >}}
